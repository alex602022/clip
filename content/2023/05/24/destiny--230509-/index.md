Yesterday was my 42nd birthday, and I have a habit of writing something for myself every year. This year, I found that many of the feelings I wrote about last year still apply. I'll simply copy and paste them here and then add a few more points:

-   I feel that before the age of thirty, people's mindsets, especially their thinking patterns, are like that of a player. But after turning forty, the mindset slowly shifts to that of a coach. As a player, one focuses on improving personal abilities and competes fiercely. In the coach's state, one is already aware of the disorder and complexity of the world and needs to have their own approach to deal with and adapt, using limited resources to create relatively higher value.

-   Life is a roller-coaster experience. Emotions, states, creativity, and physical strength all have their ups and downs. Recognise this and accept it.

-   Chaos, disorder, and imperfections are the truths of the world and our way of thinking. Get used to and embrace them while learning how to face them.

-   Time spent on workouts and sleep is always a good investment in terms of input-output ratio.

-   Don't try to control the external world; instead, strive to observe and control your own inner self and actions. It was only after realising this that I discovered I am a Stoic.

-   There's no need to convince others; don't waste time arguing unless the argument creates value.

-   Be an ordinary and confident person. Recognise your limitations but have confidence in yourself. Don't rely on appearance, physique, money, position, or even knowledge and insights (this is difficult) or other people's recognition (this is the most difficult) to prove yourself.

-   Be authentic. Know your true self, and don't deliberately pretend to be someone you're not. Don't design your own persona, but design your own life.

-   Don't give advice to others, and don't be eager to teach. Make demands on yourself but have no expectations of others.

-   Everyone has their own worldview; in most cases, other people's worldviews have nothing to do with me.

-   Accept my uniqueness and, more importantly, my mediocrity.

-   Understand the complexity of the world, or rather, understand that the world is complex. People can never exhaust all possibilities, and that's fine. Having deeply understood this, I have more respect for my own perspectives and opinions. The world is skewed, according to my understanding, but that's fine, and it's good.

-   Language is becoming less important, while experience and intuition are becoming more important.

-   "To do one's best and leave the rest to destiny" may be the most realistic idealist's view of life.
