We are looking for our first engineer fully dedicated to helping grow Readwise.

Build (and fully own) our tracking, analytics, and experimentation infrastructure and tools across our web, iOS, and Android apps for [Readwise Reader](http://readwise.io/read) as well as architecting and building our data tech stack (ie data warehouse, business intelligence, dashboards).

Work with product leaders to analyze user data and metrics to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be leveraged to improve growth. Utilize A/B testing, cohort analysis, and other statistical methods to measure and validate the impact of growth experiments.

Help manage our integrations with other apps. We have 30+ integrations and growing — you’ll work with other engineers on our team to prioritize and maintain these integrations to keep our users connected and happy.

Our developers operate with extreme autonomy: you’ll own new features, abstractions, infrastructure all the way from planning to building to shipping.

Senior-level engineer — You’re comfortable shipping features from beginning to end with minimal guidance or oversight and have done so in multiple teams/contexts. You can work effectively across the stack from top to bottom. You’re equally as comfortable shipping user-facing experiences as you are writing custom queries to analyze experiment results.

Passionate about growth — You’re excited and motivated by driving more people to use and stay using Readwise. You’re into finding innovative ways to drive user acquisition, retention, and revenue. You know that growth features are significantly higher risk/reward that core product features and you’re down to treat “failed” iterations as rapid learning. You want to win.

Attention to detail — Measuring and improving growth is often about the details. You should be thorough and excited to get things set up “right”.

Nonfiction reader & self-learner — Everyone on our team is genuinely passionate about [what we’re working on](https://blog.readwise.io/readwise-reading-app/) and we hope you are too ;)

Humble — Nothing is beneath you. If pixels need to be debugged for a few days, so be it.

Experience working on a large-scale, complex apps.

Experience working with modern data tech stack tools such as data integration ELs (eg Segment, Fivetran), data warehouses (eg Snowflake, BigQuery), and business intelligence tools (eg Metabase, Canvas).

Our backend is Python, Django, Redis, Postgres hosted on Heroku/DigitalOcean — if you’re familiar with this stack and can hack on our (smallish) backend, that’s great!

Although certainly not required, we love seeing code or live demos!

Readwise is a product which aims to help people learn and better themselves — we're not here to optimize ads or screen time.

We are here to innovate entirely new ways of reading, writing, remembering, and improving.

Readwise is a product which aims to help people learn and better themselves — we're not here to optimize ads or screen time.

We are here to innovate entirely new ways of reading, writing, remembering, and improving.

We're a fast-growing startup with so many problems to solve and so little time.

We're self-funded (aka bootstrapped), sustainable, and profitable.

Our existing niche product positions us to go after a massive adjacent market.

We are still a small team of 14 (including 6 engineers) requiring ownership and self-direction.

We are distributed to the core: max 1.5 meetings a week with no bureaucracy or time-wasting.

You will own the features and projects you take on — from shaping to shipping.

Did we mention we ship, ship, and ship?

Competitive salary & equity

Freedom to work from anywhere with a remote-first, mostly async organization

Biannual ad hoc get-togethers for smaller teams

The autonomy and fun of working at a no-nonsense, nimble startup
