What advice would those near the end of their work lives give those just starting out?
那些即将结束工作生涯的人会给刚刚开始工作的人什么建议？

A fifty-something friend emailed the other day: “Will likely stop full-time work this year . . . retirement beckons!” I was surprised, because it seemed only about 15 minutes ago that he’d been my twenty-something student-housemate, sprawled on the sofa in his underpants in mid-afternoon.  

一位五十多岁的朋友前几天发邮件说：“今年可能会停止全职工作。” 。 。 退休在召唤！”我很惊讶，因为似乎就在大约 15 分钟前，他还是我二十多岁的学生室友，在下午三点左右穿着内裤躺在沙发上。

At 54, I’ve started hearing from people my age or barely older that they are “running out of ambition” or heading into “preretirement”, that antechamber between career and pension. Others suffer health scares, lose confidence in their bodies and start winding down. Their exits affect my work too: every time a friend retires, a piece of your network dies. As my generation enters the final stretch of the career race, I’m wondering: what did we learn about jobs, life and money that might benefit someone starting now?  

54 岁时，我开始听到与我同龄或稍大一点的人说，他们正在“失去雄心”或即将进入“退休前”，即职业生涯和养老金之间的前厅。另一些人则遭受健康恐慌，对自己的身体失去信心并开始放松。他们的退出也影响了我的工作：每当一个朋友退休时，你的网络的一部分就会消失。当我们这一代人进入职业竞赛的最后阶段时，我想知道：我们从工作、生活和金钱方面学到了什么，这些知识可能会让现在开始的人受益？

First, whatever career you choose will quite likely implode before you finish your race. I trained with local journalists in 1994. Do any of them still work in what remains of local journalism? Friends who became academics, architects or civil servants have seen their salaries and status fall remorselessly, relative to other professions and sometimes even in absolute terms. With hindsight, we should all have gone into tech.  

首先，无论你选择什么职业，都可能在你完成比赛之前崩溃。 1994 年，我与当地记者一起接受培训。他们中的任何人现在还在当地新闻业的残余部分中工作吗？成为学者、建筑师或公务员的朋友们看到，他们的薪水和地位相对于其他职业，有时甚至是绝对值，都在无情地下降。事后看来，我们都应该进入科技领域。

AI will presumably accelerate these implosions. The lesson must be: avoid narrow vocational training for a doomed job and prepare to keep adapting all your career.  

人工智能可能会加速这些内爆。我们的教训必须是：避免针对注定失败的工作进行狭隘的职业培训，并准备好不断适应你的整个职业生涯。

The big choice many people face at the outset is whether or not to pursue their vocation. Doing so is a class marker. Few people from poorer families can afford to spend years trying to become, say, a furniture restorer or a novelist. When I canvassed opinions, one woman wrote that career guidance at her state school had “pushed us to pursue what we were ‘passionate’ about, without giving the full picture of the precarity involved with certain careers”. She and others had unwittingly taken high-risk paths: “I signed up for a film degree, genuinely believing that I could viably become a full-time director or producer.”  

许多人一开始面临的重大选择是是否追求自己的职业。这样做是一个阶级标记。来自贫困家庭的人很少有能力花费数年时间尝试成为一名家具修复师或小说家。当我征求意见时，一位女士写道，她公立学校的职业指导“促使我们追求我们‘热衷’的事情，却没有全面了解某些职业所涉及的不稳定因素”。她和其他人不知不觉地走上了高风险的道路：“我报名攻读电影学位，真诚地相信我可以成为一名全职导演或制片人。”

Still, if you do have a vocation (many people don’t) and you can take the financial risk, I’d say pursue it. Otherwise, a career lasts a long time. Many of my peers are now well-off, bored and disappointed.  

不过，如果你确实有一份职业（很多人没有）并且你可以承担财务风险，我会建议你去追求它。否则，职业生涯就可以持续很长时间。我的许多同龄人现在都很富裕，但感到无聊和失望。

When I covered the City for the FT, I saw young bankers sidestep the vocation-or-security choice by embracing the fiction of “hitting my number”. They told themselves (and everyone else) that once they’d made their preassigned sum, before age 40, they would quit and become painters, winemakers etc. Eventually, an older banker explained to me that this was a fantasy.  

当我为英国《金融时报》报道伦敦金融城时，我看到年轻的银行家通过接受“拨打我的号码”的虚构来回避职业或安全的选择。他们告诉自己（以及其他所有人），一旦在 40 岁之前赚到了预先分配的金额，他们就会放弃并成为画家、酿酒师等。最终，一位年长的银行家向我解释说，这是一个幻想。

He said that with age, marriage and children, people become used to their income, draw identity from it and cannot give it up. They also come to realise that they’d be unlikely to become decent painters or winemakers if they start without any training aged 37. Anyone genuinely serious about those jobs would have a 20-year lead on them.  

他说，随着年龄的增长、结婚和生孩子，人们会习惯自己的收入，从中获得身份认同，并且无法放弃。他们还开始意识到，如果他们在 37 岁时没有经过任何培训就开始工作，那么他们不太可能成为像样的画家或酿酒师。任何真正认真对待这些工作的人都会比他们领先 20 年。

There’s a reassuring simplicity in shaping your life around income maximisation. “Looking after the family” absolves you from worrying about meaning. But I’ve noticed that there is a way around the mortgage trap. The key variable in most people’s financial standard of living isn’t their salary. It’s where they live, along with whether they ever got seriously ill or divorced. Given regional differences in house prices and the rise of remote work, young people today might be smart to take a job with a working-from-home future, then move to a cheap region when possible. A caveat: this strategy could backfire if you ever need to change careers, because the best place to do that is the big city.  

围绕收入最大化来塑造你的生活是一种令人安心的简单方式。 “照顾家庭”让你不用担心意义。但我注意到有一种方法可以绕过抵押贷款陷阱。大多数人的财务生活水平的关键变量不是他们的工资。这是他们居住的地方，以及他们是否曾患过重病或离婚。考虑到房价的地区差异和远程工作的兴起，今天的年轻人可能会明智地选择一份未来可以在家工作的工作，然后在可能的情况下搬到价格便宜的地区。需要注意的是：如果您需要改变职业，这种策略可能会适得其反，因为这样做的最佳地点是大城市。

Something else I’ve seen along the way: so much of career success is knowing how to behave at work. The usual advice is, “Just be yourself.” But this only applies if you’re a member of the dominant demographic in your workplace: a working-class man on a building site, a middle-class woman in a teachers’ staff room, a young white man in a tech start-up. Anyone else needs to learn the dominant group’s codes of dress, humour, eating etc and put them on like a costume every morning.  

一路上我还看到了一些事情：职业成功很大程度上取决于知道如何在工作中表现。通常的建议是“做你自己”。但这仅适用于你是工作场所中的主导人群的情况：建筑工地的工薪阶层男性、教师办公室的中产阶级女性、科技初创公司的年轻白人。其他人都需要学习主导群体的着装、幽默、饮食等准则，并每天早上像穿戏服一样穿上它们。

One day the career will end, probably either sooner or later than you wanted. Don’t kid yourself that your institution cares about individuals. The point of an institution is that it can function without any particular individuals. The end is harshest for people who draw their identity from their job.  

有一天，职业生涯将会结束，可能比你想要的早或晚。不要欺骗自己说你的机构关心个人。机构的要点在于它可以在没有任何特定个人的情况下发挥作用。对于那些从工作中汲取自我认同的人来说，结局是最残酷的。

Last, if any young people read this, I hope they will benefit from the wisest piece of career advice I received in response to my callout. It’s from someone called Rafe Conn: “Think very carefully before opening an outdoor business in Manchester.”  

最后，如果有年轻人读到这篇文章，我希望他们能从我针对我的呼吁而收到的最明智的职业建议中受益。这是来自一个名叫拉夫·康恩 (Rafe Conn) 的人的消息：“在曼彻斯特开设户外业务之前，请务必仔细考虑。”
